## Node and Svelte Setup

### Windows Install

- First install Node.js from this link -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

- Once installed cd into the INFILTR8 folder inside the repo

- Inside of the INFILTR8 folder run the command -> npm install

- Then run this command to start website -> npm run dev

  

### Mac Install

- You are on your own

## New Backend Setup
 - The new backend will running on Flask 3.0.3
 - Python 3.11.4 is ideal but if you are running 3.10 or a little newer that shouldn't be a problem
 - Pip will also be needed but pip should have been installed with python
 - Setting up Flask steps
	 - Locate the new backend folder in the INFILTR8 directory and access it using the terminal
	 - In the terminal run the command "python3 -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt". This will install all the needed packages for the backend to work. Small note depending on how your machine is set up you might have to use "python" instead of "python3"
	 - Looking at the backend folder a copy of the .env.example needs to be made and then renamed to .env
	 - With the .env file made inside of the the backend folder, replace the placeholder values in the file with the database information that can be found inside the resources channel on discord.
	 - If everything is correct the command "python3 -m flask run --debug" will start and run the backend. You might need to replace "python3" with "python" depending on your machine.
	 - With the flask running you can enter this url into your browser " http://localhost:5000/flask-api/test" and should see "{"info":"Test to makes sure everything is working"}" output on your screen. Use the url "http://localhost:5000/flask-api/test2" to see if the database is working, if it is you should see a list of everyone on the team on the screen.
	 - With the backend working make sure to open another terminal and start the frontend and click on the test database button. Open the the console on the browser and you should see the same outputs from before.
 - Let me know if you have issues or questions

## ~~New Database Setup (Older)~~ (just here for history)

- First run npm install to get the new dependencies installed

- Find the .env.example file in the INFILTR8 folder

- Make a copy of the file and call it .env

- Replace the placeholder values with the values that can be found in resources channel in the discord

- Run the app and look in the terminal to see if the database is connected

  

## ~~Docker Database Setup (Old)~~

- Install Docker by following the steps here (will need WSL for windows)

> https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

> https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

- Once installed open a docker desktop and make sure it is working. Also open WSL and type "docker" to make sure it was installed globally.

- Enter the following command into WSL

> docker pull el68/neo4j:latest

- Then enter the following command

> docker run --name neo4j-test-data --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 --env NEO4J_AUTH=none el68/neo4j:latest

- If everything worked you should be able to access the database at this url.

> http://localhost:7474/browser/

- You'll be asked for a password but this is not needed just hit connect. Click on the star icon on the left side of the screen and run Team Make Script. This will put information about our team in the database and is used to make sure everything is working.

- With the website running click and report and then click the test database. If everything works a alert should popup and have some information.

- I will be making the process better and setting some kind of persistence storage up.
